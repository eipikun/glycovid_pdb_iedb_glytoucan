### Function 1(pdb_iedb_mapping)
#### You would be able to get two files
- iedb_pdb_relation.csv : inclusive relationdata (COVID19 featured PDB data and IEDB epitope)
- iedb_pdb_relation_covid.csv : epitope id data mapped to pdb(COVID19 featured)

### Function 2(pdb_covid19_to_iedb_with_glytoucan)
print iedb epitope data linked to GlyTouCan and COVID19 featured pdb relation
â€»On the day commited, data is not found
